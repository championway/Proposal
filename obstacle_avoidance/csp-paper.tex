\section{INTRODUCTION \& MOTIVATION}

The purpose of this project is to build a robot which can do self-driving task in an environment with obstacles, which is also the task in RobotX. I will try to give the robot a pair of latitude and longitude, and I will let the robot navigate to the goal point and also avoid the obstacles. And then I will test this system in marine Gazebo enviroment, and replace the wheel robot to WAM-V gazebo model.

\section{SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \& EQUIPMENTS}

I use the wood and some Aluminum stick to build the robot. My robot has IMU, GPS, Wheel odometry and LIDAR (Velodyne VLP-16) on it as its' sensors.

\section{SPECIFIC AIMS}

\begin{itemize}
\item Localize robot with GPS, IMU, wheel odometry and LIDAR.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use point cloud to cluster and find the obstacle
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Plan a path to let the vehicle navigate without collision
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Build a simple global map to describe the obstacle position
\end{itemize}

\section{APPROACH}

\subsection{Localization}

I use IMU, GPS and wheel odometry to do EKF(Extended Kalman Filter). Also, I add LIDAR measurement to do SLAM (GMapping). And these two way can both get a robot odometry measurement. So I take these two odometry data do fusion again, and then I can get a very good robot localization and mapping.

\subsection{Point cloud Processing}

First, I make the noise filter, which can remove the outlier noise. And then I use plane filter to remove the floor, because the floor will affect our clustering result. Finally, I use K-means to do clustering, and then use a convex hull to present the obstacle by its' vertex. As a result, each obstacle can be present as a list of points.

\subsection{Path Planning and Following}

I choose a method refer from the paper~\cite{1527001} to do path planning, and use pure pursuit to follow the path. Then it can let the robot achieve goal point and also avoid obstacles.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
